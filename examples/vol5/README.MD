### Summary

The approach for this example was a progressive reveal of my selections for the '12 Super Netballers of Christmas.' To review this progressive reveal you can check out this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/aaron_s_fox/status/1466247780905603072). Additional visualisations of some player data are also available in the 'outputs' folder of this directory.

### Code

The `vol5_example.py` script in this folder contains the code used to generate this figure. Note that this code is a bit messy given the progressive reveal approach, but it still may be useful to review for those interested in how the figure was generated. I ran this using Python v3.9.5, taking advantage of the `pandas` library for the data management and the `matplotlib` libraries for the data visualisation.
