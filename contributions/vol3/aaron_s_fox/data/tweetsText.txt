Things Ive learnt from the #SSNTrade period: 1. @FirebirdsQld have no concept of time 2. The @NSWSwifts social media team have my heart forever 3. Netball Twitter is the best thing thats happened to me this year #netballchaos
==========
From my count 16/80 players in the upcoming season will be internationals  Considering that only 1 new international was signed and 5 did not resign we have more Aussie talent in the competition this year compared to last! Overall 5% down in internationals #netball #ssn #ssntrade
==========
Now that #SSNTrade is over why not throw out some grades for how each team did! Vixens - A - added talent to an already packed squad, kept   Swifts - A - kept core squad that has won 2 out of last 3 titles. Solid.  1/3 #SSNTrade
==========
Now that #SSNTrade is finished, Ive run my eye over every team together and dissected them ahead of the 2022 season. Coming soon to a Twitter feed near you  https://t.co/3r0REsEz0T

@AdelaideTBirds can redeem themselves by signing Donnell Wallam  #ssntrade #SSNSignings #netballchaos
==========
@SCLightning_fan @AdelaideTBirds I'd be happy for them to sign both and run Horjus at WA/GA swing. I think Cbass would be great with Horjus or Dwan and Wallam would learn so much from Cbass and offers more movement in GS if required. #SSNSignings #SSNTrade
==========
@AdelaideTBirds quiet on the GS position so far this #SSNSignings period. How would the birds signing CBass or Wallam make you feel about the team? #SSNTrade

So whos left? Swifts, Pies, Vix, Giants all with full squads Lightning with one place left, Firebirds with 2(?) left TBirds with 40% and Fever with 60% of their squad to still name? Is that right? #SSNTrade

I see so much about Bragg to swifts etc, but another option is Emily Burgess who is a TP and debut for Swifties this year. Also just gona say Id love to see Teigan Oshannassy signed too. #SSNTrade and who knows maybe even TP Kelly singleton too for the shooting spot.

I know this is likely very inaccurate... but if anyone sees this please let me know your thoughts #SSNTrade https://t.co/XSF0XThyNF

With the news of Rudi Ellis to Fever,Im thinking of possible trades still to come - Bragg to Swifts  - Smith and ATN to Lightning  - Moore to Firebirds - Dwan to Vixens - Mundy to TBirds - Lewis to Giants Im likely wrong but I think were all in for some surprises #SSNTrade
==========
Ok, new theory. Magpies are going to try to appeal to the umpires and sign a team full of GA/GS/WA. Cause then theyll just get all the calls cause umpires love attackers #SSNTrade
==========
I think a definite signing for Swifts will be Teigan OShannassy. Also what happened to Georgia Marshall? She would be a good replacement for Garbin #ssntrade
==========
How am I expected to sleep tonight after all that chaos? #SSNTrade

Thoughts on whether we will see any new internationals join SSN this year? Surely at least one VSNL player but who? #SSNTrade

Just a reminder that the journo who wrote the story doesnt write the headline, so dont take the hate out on the writer of said story. Its not their fault. #SSNTrade

Ellis to Fever has me scratching my head, its great for Fever but with Tara injured you would think she'd stay at Birdies maybe Dan has told her that Courtney will be playing GD more... either way he will be a great coach for both of them  #SSNTrade

Guys I've been thinking about how Housby cryptically posted her tat of a bird and #47 and at the time I kinda thought it might mean she is leaving and now other people have had the same theories #ssntrade

NETBALL | Yesterday, it was announced that Sophie Garbin will not return to @NSWSwifts in 2022. Today, we pose the question of where the talented goal shooter could end up  #SSNTrade : AAP Image/James Ross https://t.co/s9FpxD71qb

Me arriving to curling Australia's gala ball. After @conciergemaree and I start taking over curling Australias social media. Because netball clubs ignore us when we serve socials to them on a platter.  #ssntrade #curlingaustralia https://t.co/d496PcQcPN

Huge shout out to @NSWSwifts substantive press release giving each outgoing players deserved farewell words and Akle taking time to give personal quotes! Not surprised at all - this is just feel good vibes! #SSNTrade

When #ssntrade is currently just beloved players leaving your team.   Can we get some Swifts re-signing news soon? Klau? Proud? Hadley? Somebody? https://t.co/D0dsZ0rjVC
==========
Since Swifts have so many that can play WA, what position do you think they will be looking to recruit to cover Haythornthwaite? Maybe another WD? Sligar, Eddy...  #SSNtrade

I saw Braz in green before I saw the account or rest of the pic and PANICKED omg #ssntrade https://t.co/qCsniXTbpV

@dcoppel @ellymc24 @acat493 @sarahjwildy 100% back this! I'd love to see people tuning in every night hear players explain their motivations behind staying/leaving. Would also help to draw attention to Netball on the Fox/Kayo Network to promote the sport before Season 2022 competition begins. #SSNTrade

I'm proposing Nyah Allen to the Swifts #SSNTrade

Another @NSWSwifts confirms their exit - @nataliesymone heading home. #SSNTrade https://t.co/ow7hBJAEMn

Just an FYI the correct guess for those trade rumours from my riddles will get a merch pack for the new club the player signs with. It will be the fastest most accurate guess.  #ssntrade
==========
@overathirdpod Oooooh, GOOD one. #SSNTrade

Couldnt have said it better myself!  #SSNTrade https://t.co/asOdpfbbEP

Im very invested in the threads of this hashtag #SSNTrade

Ok what about a pink lady apple(Tbird) to Giants or vice versa Sterling to Giants? Austin or Dwyer to Tbirds? #ssntrade https://t.co/JzZIb5OOr1

This is so good! I wonder which players are going still, Dwan and Browne at Pies would be *chefs kiss* #ssntrade https://t.co/7fPRp7X2m1

They do need an injury replacement for Tara... so much talent on show yesterday #SSNTrade #ssntrade https://t.co/DLQx0cUJ7l
==========
The Vixens had red apples and an orange in their signing live last night - I think Sophie Garbin might be the Apple. No idea what the orange is though! #SSNTrade
==========
Dunkley or Mimi to Fever? Dwan to Vixens? This is so frustrating, I've never been good at not knowing things  #SSNTrade #ssntrade https://t.co/zYWXGi6aQ7

Loving that the netty world is keeping us guessing and in suspense! @FirebirdsQld now also in on the game! #SSN #ssntrade https://t.co/jqTilUFNjR

Also you know how popular #SSNTrade is becoming I had relevant searches for brimstone before even SEEING this tweet. https://t.co/cMQNsiZG1p
==========
@BLT_86 I am way to invested in this trade period. These tweets causing carnage to all netty diehards!! #ssntrade
==========
The idea of a @maddyproud without @sophiegarbin is too much for a Monday  #ssnsignings #SSNTrade
==========
Two players are ready to fly.  and brimstone is high. Interstate they go  &amp; ***** their paths do head. I honestly can't wait for them to shred  #ssntrade

@FirebirdsQld @LNixon9 Me right now trying to figure out this riddle.. #SSNTrade https://t.co/CCnn6M49C2
==========
So back to riddles and rhymes...  You have given us the biggest clue. It ain't Garbin but it might have something to do with the Vixens...so would we say she's perhaps another Sunshine Girl maybe even someone who is 1.92m tall.  #SSNTrade https://t.co/GkN9FdtRYH
==========
#SSNTrade https://t.co/h0pzkz0rEK
==========
@BLT_86 @conciergemaree Ummm Luke get with the program, unified hashtag! #SSNTrade
==========
Sorry i do love the Vixens and oloney but seriously underwhelming. I don't see them signing anyone that's going to be a massive shock I think them and the Swifts will be the static teams with few changes #SSNtrade
==========
So there you have it, we have rhymed and riddled all day but the @MelbourneVixens first signing for 2022 is the ever reliant and force to be reckoned with Kate Moloney.   #SSNTrade #SuperNetball2022 https://t.co/t4DshckUxz
==========
Were going to get to 100% double-vaxxed before we get all of the #SSNSignings. #SSNTrade #SuncorpSuperNetball
==========
SOUND THE ALARM    @MelbourneVixens captain, Kate Moloney will call the Vixens home for her tenth year, having signed with the club for 2022.   Full story here: https://t.co/qngL7RJNUa  #SSNSignings https://t.co/MVu9bA6Rlz
==========
 NEW SIGNING   The @MelbourneVixens have kicked off the signing period in style, signing captain and star Diamonds mid-courter @katemoloney_ on a one year deal. Moloney becomes the first player signed by any @SuperNetball team for the 2022 season. #WitnessFearless #SSNTrade https://t.co/EwgNAIGlzb

Next time I make a #SSNTrade thread Rumours edition.

Kate Maloney #SSNTrade  STAYING AT Vixens

The @katemoloney_ news is equally excellent and unsurprising  Show us the actual tea #SSNTrade

I cant believe the vixens bamboozled us  #SSNTrade

So if we assume all specialist GS are staying we have Fowler Aiken MJ Garbin Wallace Harten Potgeiter Koenan &amp; Nelson to fit in plus players like Wallam Cbass Samason etc plus all the GA's the league needs more teams #SSNTrade
==========
There is almost too much hype around #SSNTrade my mind is running wild, Im swimming in uni work and all I wanna do is an investigative analysis on the history of apples and oranges
==========
@amandamary94 @BLT_86 Omfg if Jo goes home, Sophie could be playing for Giants with Keira or Sophie Dwyer! #SSNTrade

IS SOPHIE GARBIN THE OR THE AND CREAM?! #SSNTrade @BLT_86

Sophie Garbin #SSNTrade  DEPARTING Swifts  GOING TO

Binnian Hunt #SSNTrade  DEPARTING Lightning  GOING TO  Pulse
==========
Kristiana Manua #SSNTrade  DEPARTING  Giants  GOING TO  Pulse 
==========
Am I missing something or is Sophie's trade to Lightning far more likely than Vixens? A Wood/Garbin combo, could you imagine  #SSNTrade
==========
@jeremypeterrich @JessLMas @Abbey_McCulloch @TheGoalCircle Also my sister just said her and Keira at Vixens would be incredible! We also haven't considered if Jo goes home she may be heading to the Giants #SSNTrade
==========
I hope SG goes to Tbirds or Lightning! She would be such an asset to both teams Rahni Samason should get the extra spot at Vixens #SSNTrade
==========
 SSN Trade Thread   Because its lockdown and Im bored and apparently tracking this on a spreadsheet is not enough. Confirmed movements only. #SSNTrade

scl give us some news please #SSNTrade

UPDATED #SSNTrade Movement Tracker:  - Maweni, Proscovia and Hunt out at Lightning - Stanton out at Vixens - Poolman and Man'ua out at Giants - Garbin out at Swifts                         ************************  - Wallam and Bassett returning to Aus from UK/NZ

@RenInOz Are we including CBass in any calculations? Unlikely to come back to SSN? #SSNTrade

Okay, so here's what we know so far:  - Maweni and Proscovia out at Lightning - Stanton out at Vixens - Poolman out at Giants - Garbin out at Swifts  Have I missed any, fam? #SSNTrade

@heyycourtt @netballgoogles #SSNTrade won my v informal poll, and I've notified the clubs of same, lol
==========
WAIT SOPHIE LEAVING MEANS NEW SHOOTER AT SWIFTS I was not prepared for this, convinced myself the roster wouldnt change #SSNTrade
==========
@georgjar @netballgoogles Yup, the majority went with #SSNTrade (I did think some of my other offerings were pithier, but I'm nothing if not collegiate )
==========
Yes girl go get that starting spot @sophiegarbin #SSNTrade https://t.co/fjzn3IGekl
